# XML & Qt
Dear lazy programmers who are looking for a working code to read (and write) XML files, look no further. Don't bother reading whole Qt docs (http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qxmlstreamreader.html) and take this code!
Here I tried using QXmlStreamReader for nested xml document. Qt has bunch of useful tools, but it was the easiest one I found. By this date I only have the reader and I will add writer whenever I have to write one! (Whchi will not take long...)
Also if you spot a bug, crush it. I'll be very happy.
Have fun!
