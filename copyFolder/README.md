# Qt folder copy
Dear lazy programmers who are looking for a working code copy files and folders in Qt, look no further. Don't bother reading whole Qt docs (http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qfile.html) and take this code!
Here I've used some QFile and QDirIterator to copy folders and files. This method will copy files and folders with preserved names. But if your folder has sub-folders, call this recursively or whatever fits your code.
Have fun!
