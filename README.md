# QtSnippets
Little Qt code snippets for beginners and lazy coders.
These codes are not perfect. Actually they are not even close to the perfection! TBH they are garbage. :v But also they are so handy and easy to understand. These codes are designed to perform simple tasks and give you the idea to write whatever you want.
I don't have enough time to maintain these codes, so if you have time, send the updates and improvements and I will be very happy.
Have fun!
